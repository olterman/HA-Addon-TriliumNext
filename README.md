# Addon Repository

# About
This is a Fork of Hypercrisis - TriliumNext Addon ... all I have done is update so that it pulls latest build. 

# Support
For project related support please visit the corresponding project site.
If you have problems with the addon you can open an issue here.

# Info
I'm not a Dev, I just have fun trying out new things.
If something is not yet available but I want to have it, I try my best to get it done and if it works out, I am happy to release it for everybody. :)
